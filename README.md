[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard--readme-OK-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)


## Read our Launch Plan

Risk is a new group, focused on metrics for issues pertaining to Risk in open source.

Economic value is expressed in different ways for different types of
stakeholders.  We will be exploring this space in the coming months.

| Focus Area | Goal |
|------------|------|
|1. [Business Risk](focus-areas/business-risk) | Understand how active a community exists around/to support a given software package. |
|2. [Code Quality](focus-areas/code-quality) | Understand the quality of a given software package.|
|3. [Licensing](focus-areas/licensing) | Understand the potential IP issues associated with a given software package’s use.|
|4. [Security](focus-areas/security) | Understand security processes and procedures associated with the software’s development.|
|5. [Transparency](focus-areas/transparency) | Understand how transparent a given software package is with respect to dependencies, licensing (?), security processes, etc.|
|6. [Dependency Risk Assessment](focus-areas/dependency-risk-assessment) | Understand software dependency risk.|

## Background

### Problem Statement

We have gotten requests from community members to establish industry-standard
metrics for risk in open source.  Lack of metrics makes it difficult
for business decision makers to compare open-source methods to alternatives.
Lack of metrics makes it difficult to allocate resources optimally across
projects, slowing decision making and product innovation.

### Opportunity

We believe that risk metrics can accelerate the adoption of open source
methods within industry, providing more opportunities for developers to make a
living wage in open source.

### Goal

Identify Stakeholders and Validate Interest
- Identify market segments and stakeholders
- Understand Who cares about Open Source Risk (and why)
- Specify and prioritize Key Performance Indicators
- Calculate potential aggregate risk

Grow hands-on community
- CHAOSS Members: Consultants, researchers, grant writers
- Project Stakeholders: Sponsors, maintainers, contributors, consumers

Build reusable assets
- Repeatable methodology for discovering value
- MVP Tooling with Development Roadmap

In the long term, we’d like to publish trusted industry-standard Risk Metrics.
A kind of S&P for software development, an authoritative source for metrics
significance and industry norms.  

### Work To Date

We're just getting started!
