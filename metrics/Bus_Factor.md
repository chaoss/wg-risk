# Bus Factor

Question: How high is the risk to a project should the most active people leave?

## Description  
The Bus Factor is a compelling metric because it visualizes the question "how many contributors can we lose before a project stalls?" by hypothetically having these people get run over by a bus (more pleasently, how many would have to win in a lottary and decide to move on).

The Bus Factor is the smallest number of people that make 50% of contributions.


## Objectives  
* Identify how widely the work in a project is distributed across contributors.
* Identify the key people in a project that are doing the majority of the work.

## Implementation  
The formula for Bus Factor is a percentage calculation -50% will be our threshold-
followed by adding up each contributor's contributions sorted in decreasing order until we reach
the threshold.

If we have 8 contributors who each contribute the following number of contributions to a project: `1000, 202, 90, 33, 332, 343, 42, 433`, then we can determine the Bus Factor by first identifying the 50% of total contributions for all the contributors.

**Summary:** 50% of total contributions = `1,237.5`, so the Bus Factor is `2`.

**Full Solution:**
1. Arrange the data in descending order: `1000, 433, 343, 332, 202, 90, 42, 33`
2. Compute the 50% of the total:
   -  `(1,000 + 433 + 343 + 332 + 202 + 90 + 42 + 33) * 0.5 = 1,237.5`
3. Adding up the first two contributors in our ranking we get `1,433`.
4. **Answer**: as `1,433 > 1,237.5`, more than the 50% of contributions is performed by only `2` contributors, thus the `Bus Factor = 2`.

### Filters
* Time: The Bus Factor may be vary for different time periods. The Bus Factor over the life of a project may misrepresent the current level of contributor engagement in the project.
* Repository Group: Many open source projects include multiple repositories, and in some cases examining all of the repositories associated with any given project provides a more complete picture of the Bus Factor.

### Visualizations (optional)

The Bus Factor for the CHAOSS Project in 2020, when considering only git commits, was 5.

### Tools Providing the Metric
1. [Augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur)
2. [GrimoireLab](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab) provides this metric out of the box, not as a single number but as a visualization.

### Data Collection Strategies
The data collection strategy depends on the [Types of Contributions](https://chaoss.community/metric-types-of-contributions/) used for calculating the Bus Factor. Bus Factor is often calculated for commits but other types of contributions can be used for this as well, separately or combined.
