# Supply Chain Risk 

Question: How to evaluate supply chain risk

## Description
Due to the expanding scope of software applications, software security is not limited to virtual space, but directly threatens the security of physical space, and any problems in the supply chain will cause serious harm.The biggest problem in the field of software supply chain security is that with the exponential growth in the number of open source software, security issues cannot be ignored

## Objectives

Assess the risks in the software supply chain to solve this problem.

## Implementation 

collect the data:
1.The spread of risk in the software supply chain

2.Affect the software involved

3.Developer safety awareness and project management level (ranking)

4.Difficulty of ensuring software supply chain security (ranking)

5.Repair and detect known vulnerabilities(ranking)

6.Download unofficial software and tools without full security checks

7.The version of the software library
