# Supply Chain Risk 

Question: How to evaluate supply chain risk

## Description
Due to the expanding scope of software applications, software security is not limited to virtual space, but directly threatens the security of physical space, and any problems in the supply chain will cause serious harm.The biggest problem in the field of software supply chain security is that with the exponential growth in the number of open source software, security issues cannot be ignored

## Objectives

As an open source project, network supply chain security needs to be treated with more caution. Assess the risks in the software supply chain to solve this problem. It is this open network that brings many security risks to the flow of information. Chaoss is obligated to conduct a supply chain risk assessment for each open source project.High-risk projects are warned by Chaoss that the content needs to be changed initially or the project may be suspended. After the risk assessment of the project, Chaoss can also evaluate the risk according to each risk and alert the potential risk. Supply chain risks include not only producers, but also users, who should be warned when using high-risk projects. Chaoss will not be responsible for any harm caused by this product.

## Implementation 

Collect the data for each open source project:

1.The spread of risk in the software supply chain

2.Affect the software involved

3.Developer safety awareness and project management level 

4.Difficulty of ensuring software supply chain security 

5.Repair and detect known vulnerabilities

6.Download unofficial software and tools without full security checks

7.The version of the software library
