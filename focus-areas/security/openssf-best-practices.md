# Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge

**Question:** What is the current OpenSSF Best Practices status for the project?

## Overview
The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge, from the Linux Foundation, allows open source projects to voluntarily self-certify that they follow open source best practices. Projects can use the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge web application to explain how they adhere to each best practice. A project receives a passing badge if it meets all the required criteria. 

The badge focuses on cybersecurity in open source software, helping to ensure that projects follow best practices for producing secure, high-quality software.

The **OpenSSF Best Practices Badge**:
- Indicates a project's compliance with "open source project best practices" as defined by the Linux Foundation’s core infrastructure initiative.
- Encourages open source projects to produce secure software by adhering to established best practices.
- Enables consumers to assess which open source projects are more likely to produce secure, reliable software based on their compliance with these best practices.

### Data Collection Strategies
From the [OpenSSF Best Practices Badging Page](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en), a project’s OpenSSF Best Practices status can be assessed when:
- Projects receive a passing badge if they meet all required criteria.
- The status of each criterion, for a given project, can be 'Met', 'Unmet', 'N/A' or 'unknown'.
- Each criterion is in one of four categories: 'MUST', 'SHOULD', 'SUGGESTED', or 'FUTURE'.
- To obtain a badge, all the MUST and MUST NOT criteria must be met, all SHOULD criteria must be met OR the rationale for not implementing the criterion must be documented, and all SUGGESTED criteria have to be rated as met or unmet.
- Advanced badge levels of silver and gold are available if the project satisfies the additional criterion.

For further information, refer to [OpenSSF’s API documentation](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en) 

### Filters
The metric can be filtered by:
- Badge level (Passing, Silver, Gold)
- Project type or focus area (e.g., cybersecurity projects)
- Criteria status (Met, Unmet, N/A, Unknown)
- Compliance trends over time
