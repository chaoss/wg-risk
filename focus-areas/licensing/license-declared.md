# License Declared

**Question:** What are the declared software package licenses?

## Overview

License Declared measures the total number and specific licenses declared in a software package which include both software and documentation source files. Data points consist of a list of unique licenses and the corresponding number of files associated with each license.<br>
For Example: License types with number of files

To understand the declared licenses is critical for several reasons:

*   Software packages often contain multiple licenses. Knowing the declared licenses is vital for compliance purposes during software acquisition.
*   Licenses can create conflicts such that not all obligations can be fulfilled across all licenses in a software package. Licenses Declared can provide transparency on potential license conflicts present in software packages.

Understanding license conflicts is crucial to avoid legal issues and ensure smooth integration of software components.

*   Time: Licenses declared in a repository can change over time as the dependencies of the repository change. One of the principle motivations for tracking license presence, aside from basic awareness, is to draw attention to any unexpected new license introduction.
*   Declared and Undeclared: Separate enumeration of files that have license declarations and files that do not.
