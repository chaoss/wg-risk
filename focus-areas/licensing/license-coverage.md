# License Coverage

**Question:** How much of the code base has declared licenses?

## Overview

License Coverage measures the proportion of code and documentation files in a software repository that have explicitly declared licenses. The data points are the number of files with declared licenses and the total number of files in the repository, expressed as a percentage. This provides transparency about the licensing terms governing the code, which is crucial for both internal and external use. License coverage provides insight into the percentage of files in a software package that have a declared license, leading to two use cases:

*   A A software package sourced for internal organizational use: Declared license coverage can highlight points of interest or concern when using that software package.
*   A software package provided to external, downstream projects: Declared license coverage offers transparent license information, which is necessary for downstream integration, deployment, and use.

*   Time: Licenses declared in a repository can change over time as the dependencies of the repository change. One of the principle motivations for tracking license presence, aside from basic awareness, is to draw attention to any unexpected new license introduction.
