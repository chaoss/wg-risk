# SPDX Document

**Question:** Does the software package have an associated SPDX document as a standard expression of dependencies, licensing, and security-related issues?

## Overview
This metric assesses whether a software package has an associated Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) document to express dependencies, licensing, and security-related issues. An SPDX document provides essential management information for understanding and managing open-source software within complex supply chains. It offers a standardized view of dependencies, licenses, and security considerations for both internal use and downstream distribution of software packages. Having an SPDX document can support an organizationâ€™s open-source risk management routines and integrate with their overall open-source strategy.

### Data Collection Strategies
- Identify if the project has an SPDX document available, either through public repository files or internally managed records.
- Use tools like Augur-SPDX to scan project repositories and generate an SPDX document if none exists.

### Filters

[augur-SPDX](https://github.com/chaoss/augur-spdx) was used to scan the GitHub repository [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).
Here are the licenses identified from the scan in JSON format:
```
{
  "0": "Apache-2.0",
  "1": "BSD-2-Clause",
  "2": "BSD-3-Clause",
  "3": "GPL-2.0",
  "4": "GPL-2.0+",
  "5": "GPL-3.0+",
  "6": "ISC",
  "7": "MIT"
  "8": "BSD-4-Clause-UC",
  "9": "CC0-1.0"
}
```
This document was generated by Augur.
