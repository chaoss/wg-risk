# Transparency 

## Goal: Understand how transparent a given software package is with respect to dependencies, licensing (?), security processes, etc. 

### Question: Does the software package have a standard expression of dependencies, licensing, and security-related issues? 
- Metric: [Identify Software Bill of Materials](Software_Bill_of_Materials.md)

## Goal: Understand what dimensions of the project are visible organically or through metrics; or, in contrast, what is not visible but should be?
