# Test Coverage

**Question:** How well is the code tested?

## Overview
Test coverage describes the extent to which a codebase is covered by automated tests. This metric primarily focuses on two key measurements: 
1. **Subroutine Coverage:** The percentage of subroutines (e.g., functions, methods, or routines) covered by tests. 
2. **Statement Coverage:** The percentage of code statements executed during the test suite run.

This metric only measures the coverage within a repository and excludes any libraries or external software dependencies. Both of these measures provide valuable insights into how rigorously a codebase has been tested.

Test coverage is usually tracked by testing frameworks that run automated tests against the code. It helps assess the quality of a project’s code by identifying untested portions of the codebase. Understanding test coverage allows:
- **Detection of Defects:** A lack of test coverage is often correlated with a higher probability of software defects being discovered during deployment or use.
- **Assessment of Software Engineering Practices:** Higher test coverage usually indicates more rigorous development and testing practices, while low coverage may signal less mature or less rigorous development processes.

### Data Collection Strategies

### Filters
* **Time**: Changes in test coverage over time provide evidence of project attention to maximizing overall test coverage. Specific parameters include `start date` and `end date` for the time period.
* **Code_File**: Each repository contains a number of files containing code. Filtering coverage by specific file provides a more granular view of test coverage. Some functions or statements may lead to more severe software failures than others. For example, untested code in the `fail safe` functions of a safety critical system are more important to test than `font color` function testing.
* **Programming_Language**: Most contemporary open source software repositories contain several different programming languages. The coverage percentage of each `Code_File`

### Visualizations

Statements include variable assignments, loop declarations, calls to system functions, "go to" statements, and the common `return` statement at the completion of a function or method, which may or may not include the return of a `value` or `array of values`.
